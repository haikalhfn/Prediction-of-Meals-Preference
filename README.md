# Prediction-of-Meals-Preference

People look for food to eat in everyday life by purchasing ingredients from the market and cooking it at home, eating
outside at restaurants, or ordering meals from restaurants or food stalls. When people's lifestyles and other things
change, they tend to change their dietary choices as well. We do not know of any Malaysian preference meal
preparation place due to many options for meal preparation in Malaysia. Besides, Malaysians are less efficient in terms
of financial spending, especially in terms of meals budget. The study's aim is to predict preferred meal preparation in
individuals based on their lives, because every environmental lifestyle may influence their daily meal intake decision
using K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm. In this project, the preference for meal preparation among adults is analyzed.
EDA, data pre-processing, and data mining are just a few of the ways machine learning might aid with meal
preparation.
